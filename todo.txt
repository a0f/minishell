change fprintf to write (2, "lol", len);

errors and exiting
only on malloc handle exits gracefully
else let it fall through -> set status code tho

norminette
need to split up functions and split up into more .c files and make it norminette

global variable
we aren't using our one global variable but people are telling me it is required for one specific signalling thing. I'll find out

evalsheet/subject
find the evalsheet and go through the subject and make sure it atleast passes those

CTRL-C only works properly if you run a command then do it
else it kills with SIGINT


CTRL-C is broken for blocking commands -> no newline maybe

output should be:
showard@f0r5s11:~/Incomplete Projects/minishell_exe$ cat
^C
showard@f0r5s11:~/Incomplete Projects/minishell_exe$ 

minishell does:
minishell> cat (CTRL-C) 
^Cminishell> 

make sure all exits call state_free

make sure all allocations use a pool

make sure to reset pools regularly
