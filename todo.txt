change fprintf to write (2, "lol", len);

errors and exiting
only on malloc handle exits gracefully
else let it fall through -> set status code tho

norminette
need to split up functions and split up into more .c files and make it norminette

evalsheet/subject
find the evalsheet and go through the subject and make sure it atleast passes those

make sure all exits call state_free
