heredoc 
when i do cat << "lol" because its wrapped in quotes environments variables shouldn't expaned
ie. $HOME should be printed as $HOME and not the value of $HOME
but because we get rid of the quotes i have no way of knowing that it was wrapped in quotes

cat | ls doesnt hang and wait for input. it just sends the ls right away. should we be waiting per command?
I tried adding a simple waitpid but it hangs the tester on case "env | sort | grep -v SHLVL | grep -v ^_"
but when I run that command manually myself it works so I have no idea.

tester
we are passing 119/146 cases now. All the cases we are failing are in execution.
I know people eval this without passing all of them.
We need to look through and see if there are obvious ones we should be passing

errors and exiting
need to go through and replace all the errors with correct error/exit behaviour

norminette
need to split up functions and split up into more .c files and make it norminette

global variable
we aren't using our one global variable but people are telling me it is required for one specific signalling thing. I'll find out

evalsheet/subject
find the evalsheet and go through the subject and make sure it atleast passes those
