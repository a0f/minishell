parser/tokenizing issues
echo $? -> doesn't give $? as an arg so theres no way by echo to know that I need to print last exit status
i forget but one of the routes in which we handle the here_doc wont work and the parser needs to be changed for that

export HELLO="123 A-" -> is giving me HELLO= and getting rid of the quotes
minishell> export HELLO="123 A-"
program: export
input fd: 5
output fd: 6
args: [export, HELLO=, 123 A-, ]
